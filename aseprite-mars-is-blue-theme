This is a simple user interface for Aseprite that looks very clean 
and professional that best suits my visual needs and tastes.

Aseprite does not necessarily have to be ugly, this led me to work on this UI, 
inspired by the work of many people.

It is not finished yet, it is still under development and improvements, however 
you can now enjoy it. 

If you like my work, consider leaving me a donation so I can continue with the project.
